Results
For the analysis of the data we used the statistical program SPSS. Firstly, we computed correlation Pearson between the variables of impulsivity (as measured by Barrat Impulsiveness Scale-Bis11) and Reaction time (as measured by a Simple Reaction Time Task). For the record, 3 participants were excluded, as the completed only the BIS-11 survey and not the Simple reaction Time Task.  


Table 1 Mean and Std Deviation between the variables of Impulsivity and Reaction Time

	Mean	Standard Deviation
Reaction Time	687,006	359.177
Impulsivity	2.223	0.574


It follows a table which shows the correlations between the mentioned variables.


Table 2 Correlation between Reaction Time and Impulsivity

1.	Reaction Time		,012
2.	Impulsivity		
   *p<05,     **p<01


As we can see from the Table 2 there is no significant correlation between the two variables, to the point of 0.12. Also we saw from the analysis that, the statistical significance of the results, for a two tailed analysis is really low, the point off .969In the beginning of your research we decided that we will accept the results to be statistically significant to the point of p<.005 or p<.001, which clearly was not the case in our results. Given this fact, we came to the conclusion, that the possibility of this result coming from random factors is very big, fact that clearly leads us to the point to reject the research hypothesis and accept the null hypothesis. The results according to APA are presented likewise: r (11) =.012, ns.

Table 3. Scatter plot between the variables of Impulsivity and Reaction Time  



The fact that no correlation exists, can also be seen by this scatter plot, where a lot of values are seated in different areas of the diagram. This also lead us to the conclusion, that the motor reactions of a person are not associated with impulsivity as a personality characteristic.
